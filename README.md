# XBox One Controller Battery Indicator
A tray application that shows a battery indicator for an Xbox One controller and gives a notification when the battery level drops to (almost) empty.

Currently known issues/limitations:
* initial recognition of a newly connected controller can take several seconds and/or require a button press on the controller
* the low battery notification stays even when battery level changes back to good. A testing release that should fix this is available, but further testing is needed
* Only one controller is recognized/monitored

A [binary release](https://github.com/NiyaShy/XB1ControllerBatteryIndicator/releases) is available for download.
